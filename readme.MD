# PURPOSE THIS PROJECT
> In rural Kenya milk sold by farmers to cooperative societies is recorded manually. First on paper while in the field and then on computer while in the office.
> The problem with this is that a single cooperative could have 3000 active farmers. The process of taking records is very cumbersome.
> Much of the work in the office is done manually.
> As a way to ease the work an information system is needed. It needs and android mobile client for record taking and a web based office system for the management.
> This project is the backend API.
